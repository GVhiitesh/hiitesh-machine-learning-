Tesla Stock Price Prediction
--------------------------------------------
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Tesla stock closing prices using Linear Regression based on historical stock market data. The aim is to understand price behavior, analyze relationships between stock features, and build a basic machine learning model for price prediction.

The project is designed mainly for learning and demonstration purposes, covering the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.
